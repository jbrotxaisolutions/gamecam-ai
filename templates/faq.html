                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-400">Navigate to the "Manage & Upload" page from the main dashboard. On the
                        right-hand side, you'll see a form to "Add a New Camera." Simply give your camera a descriptive
                        name (e.g., "Back Ridge Stand") and provide the ZIP code for its location. The ZIP code is used
                        to gather historical weather data for your analysis.</p>

                        on the "Manage & Upload" page. First, select the camera you want to associate the images with
                        from the dropdown menu. Then, you can either click "Upload Files" to select individual images or
                        "Upload Folder" to upload all images from a specific folder on your computer.<br><br><strong>Please
                            Note:</strong> To save storage space, the image files themselves are automatically deleted
                        after 60 days (unless retained). All of your valuable data from the images is kept forever.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-400">The Prime Time Predictor is our flagship feature. It analyzes the
                        timestamps of all your sightings for a specific animal and calculates the average hourly
                        activity over time. It then highlights the top windows of activity, helping you predict the best
                        times to hunt or observe wildlife at that location.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-400">At the top of the dashboard, you can filter your data by camera,
                        animal, and date range. This allows you to focus your analysis on a specific location or
                        species. For example, you can see the prime movement times for only "Hogs" at your "River
                        Bottom" camera during the month of November.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-400">To help manage storage costs, the actual image files (.jpg, .png,
                        etc.) are automatically deleted after 60 days. However, all the important metadata—such as the
                        date, time, camera location, animal detections, and weather conditions—is saved permanently.
                        This allows your historical graphs and trend analysis to work forever. If you want to keep a
                        specific image file permanently, simply use the 'Retain' toggle on that image in the
                        gallery.</p>

                        being automatically deleted after 60 days. This is perfect for saving pictures of trophy animals
                        or unusual sightings.</p>
